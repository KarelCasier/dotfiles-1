# dotfiles
[![TravisCI Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/deathbeam/dotfiles.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deathbeam/dotfiles)

These are my configuration files for Linux and Mac. It is still work in progress, so expect a lot of changes, but I
think it is stable enough to be usable. I put this README together, because I (like most of other programmers) do not
have any life. I even added CI to this repo, because I was bored. Yes, you hear right, COUNTINUOS INTEGRATION TO
FUCKING DOTFILES REPO. I doubt anyone will ever appreciate my effort, but [frankly, my dear, I don't give a
damn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankly,_my_dear,_I_don't_give_a_damn). Expect a lot of changes in this repo,
because most of the time I just cannot make up my mind, and I change my decisions very often.

## Requirements

* [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) - Most of the installation process is managed via
  Git, so you need this one.
* [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) - Stow is used for dotfile installation (creating symlinks)

## How to install?

It is simple, just use `make`
```shell
git clone git://github.com/deathbeam/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make
```

Most of my dotfiles are using [Terminus](http://terminus-font.sourceforge.net/) font, so to make everything look
correct, install it in both TrueType and bitmap format.

## How to update?

You can just use Git:

```shell
cd ~/.dotfiles
git pull --rebase
make
```

## How to inlude your own stuff?

After you have installed dotfiles, you can start including your own stuff by creating appropriate `.local` dotfiles in
home directory:

```shell
$EDITOR ~/.gitconfig.local
$EDITOR ~/.vimrc.local
$EDITOR ~/.zshrc.local
$EDITOR ~/.tmux.conf.local
```

To add your own Vim, Tmux or Zsh plugin you can just clone it to proper `bundle` directory:

```shell
# Add SuperTab vim plugin
git clone git://github.com/ervandew/supertab ~/.vim/bundle/supertab

# Add Tmux sessionist plugin
git clone git://github.com/tmux-plugins/tmux-sessionist ~/.tmux/bundle/tmux-sessionist

# Add zsh-autoenv zsh plugin
git clone git://github.com/Tarrasch/zsh-autoenv ~/.zsh/bundle/zsh-autoenv
```
