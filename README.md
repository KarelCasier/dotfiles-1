# dotrc

This is my Vim, ZSH and Prezto configuration. It is still work in progress, so expect a lot of changes, but I think it is stable enough to be usable.

## installation

I made small automated installation script, what will update your `.zshrc`, `.zshpreztorc` and `.vimrc` and make NeoVim to use same configuration and plugins as Vim.

```shell
./script/install
```

## interface

Install [Hack for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/Hack) font.
Also, it is preferred to use [Tomorrow Night](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme) color scheme for your favorite terminal. It will look a lot better, because Vim is also using this color scheme. And also, set this Hack font for your terminal too.
